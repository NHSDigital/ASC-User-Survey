# Outputs

## Split by xyz outputs

Using the stratification process (see [mathematical documentation](mathematical_documentation.md)), calculate people's responses to the questions split by xyz

### Output types

_Table a_ - The percentage of people who responded each way to each question, pivotted (wide form)

E.g: In LA 211, 55% of people responded "3" to question 3a

_Table b_ - The estimated number of people who would have responded each way to each question, had the question been responded to by 100% of the people in social care in that local authority, pivotted (wide form)

_Table 5_ - The margin of error for the percentage, pivotted (only for split by local authority data)

_Auxiliary_ - The est_population, percentage, margin of error and all other information, in long/tall form. This output isn't rounded or suppressed.

_PowerBI_ - Essentially the auxiliary table, but rounded and suppressed, and a few other formatting changes

### Split by what

_Table 1_ - Split by local authority

_Table 2_ - Split by demographic

_Table 3_ - Split by responses to the questions - E.g: How did people who answered "3" to q3a respond to question 12?

_LA_and_response_

_LA_and_demographic_

_Average rows_ - This contains regional averages, and overall averages

## Other Table Outputs

_Table 4_ - Response rate - A simple percentage count of how many people responded, overall and to each question

_Annex Table 6_ - Demographics

Using the stratification method, we can estimate the proportions of the different demographics in England's adult social care population (e.g: we can estimate how many males there are in the population) by extrapolating from the sample we have. This table tells us our estimates of percentage of people

_DQ Annex Table 1 & 2_ - Missing admin data

What % of people were missing administrative data (like age or ethnicity) split by local authority

Table DQ 1 = Only amongst those who responded to the survey

Table DQ 2 = Amongst everyone in the sample (everyone surveyed), even if they didn't respond to the survey

_Methodology paper outputs_ - Small tables looking at the breakdown of people who responded to the survey

For example, what % of people in the sample were male, or what % of the eligible population were surveyed.

## Excel Outputs
