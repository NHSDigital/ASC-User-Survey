**ER**

**Std**

**Comb**

Certain questions are very complex, and are too difficult to answer if you are someone who's primary support reason is learning difficulties. Instead, this person will answer an easier form of the question.

If you answer the **E**asy **R**ead version, then we use the abbreviation "ER" a lot.

If you answer the **St**anar**d** version, then we use the abbreviation "Std" a lot.

E.g: Q1 Std is "Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the care and support services you receive?"

Q1 ER is "How happy are you with the way staff help you?"

Standard questions have 7 possible responses, but for ease, easy read questions have 5.

There is a **Comb**ined column that has both standard and easy read respondents in it. In this column, people who answered the standard questionnaire have their answers transformed so that there are only 5 possible responses and hence it is comparable to the easy read questions.
